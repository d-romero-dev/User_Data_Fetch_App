>**Technical Insight:**
>>
>The heart of the Code Challenge lies in the `EnviarDatos()` function. This function collects the user-input data, creates a JSON object, and sends it to a placeholder API endpoint >using the Fetch API. The server processes the data and responds with a JSON representation of the submitted information.
>>*The console.log statement ensures that developers can easily inspect the response in the browser's console.*
>
>The `fetch` function is configured with the necessary headers, including the content type as JSON. Any errors during the data submission process are caught and logged to the console, providing insight into potential issues.
